Overview

This repository contains a customized version of the BigCommerce Catalyst headless commerce storefront framework. Catalyst is built with Next.js, leverages React storefront components, and is backed by the BigCommerce GraphQL Storefront API.

This custom storefront is designed to showcase skillsets acquired while working with the Senior Support team of BigCommerce, as well as to provide hands-on experience to enhance troubleshooting. 

Relationship to Original Catalyst
This project is a fork of the official BigCommerce Catalyst repository. We regularly aim to pull in updates from the upstream Catalyst project to ensure we benefit from BigCommerce's ongoing development, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

Original Catalyst Description (from their README, for context):

Catalyst is the composable, fully customizable headless commerce framework for BigCommerce. Catalyst is built with Next.js, uses our React storefront components, and is backed by the GraphQL Storefront API. By choosing Catalyst, you'll have a fully-functional storefront within a few seconds, and spend zero time on wiring up APIs or building SEO, Accessibility, and Performance-optimized ecommerce components you've probably written many many times before.

Key Features & Customizations
Here's a summary of the significant changes and additions made in this custom repository:

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
A BigCommerce account.
Node.js version 20 or 22.
Corepack-enabled pnpm: corepack enable pnpm
Installation
Clone this repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
Install dependencies:
Bash

pnpm install
Connecting to Your BigCommerce Store
Catalyst requires connection to a BigCommerce store to fetch product data and other storefront information.

Run the Catalyst setup process:

Bash

pnpm create @bigcommerce/catalyst@latest init
Follow the prompts to connect your Catalyst project to your BigCommerce store. This will generate a .env.local file with your store's API credentials.

Note: If you already have a .env.local file from a previous setup, ensure it's configured correctly for your desired BigCommerce store and channel.

Local Development
To run the development server:

Bash

pnpm run dev
This will start the local development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
Deployment instructions will vary depending on your chosen hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, etc.).

General steps for Vercel (common for Next.js applications):

Create a new project on Vercel.
Connect your GitHub repository.
Configure environment variables (ensure all necessary BigCommerce API credentials from your .env.local are added to Vercel's environment variables).
Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and deploy it.
Refer to your chosen hosting provider's documentation for detailed deployment instructions.

**Catalyst** is the composable, fully customizable headless commerce framework for
[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/). Catalyst is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), uses
our [React](https://react.dev/) storefront components, and is backed by the
[GraphQL Storefront API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/storefront/graphql).

By choosing Catalyst, you'll have a fully-functional storefront within a few seconds, and spend zero time on wiring
up APIs or building SEO, Accessibility, and Performance-optimized ecommerce components you've probably written many
times before. You can instead go straight to work building your brand and making this your own.
